# System Configuration
Hello and welcome to the home of my personal system configuration that I use daily!

## About The Setup
My current daily-driver/EDC is an HP laptop (Model: 15-dy1074nr) running `void-linux-x86_64-musl`, built from a minimal install (as god intended). The end result is a sleek, minimal desktop in [river](https://codeberg.org/river/river), the dynamic tiling wayland compositor written in zig.

## Neovim
I've used [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for a few years now, and although the program on it's own is superb, its strong suit is in it's plugins. There are countless Neovim configurations online; you can find mine in the `/nvim/` directory of this repo.
